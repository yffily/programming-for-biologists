# Introduction to Programming for Biologists

Course materials for IDS3932 Beginners Programming for Biology, taught at Florida Atlantic University's Wilkes Honors College. Designed by Yaouen Fily (physicist), Nick Dickens (genomicist), and Andia Chaves-Fonnegra (marine ecologist).

The course is revolves around a series of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook introduces new concepts, illustrates them with examples, and contains tasks to complete. Solutions are not included.

The wolf GPS data is not included. I promised the good people of the Voyageurs Wolf Project that I wouldn't share it willy nilly.
