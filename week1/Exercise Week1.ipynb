    "## Week 1 Exercise - Calculating AT content\n",

We know that we can get the length of the sequence using the `len()` function, and we can count the number of A and T using the `count()` method. Here are a few lines of code that we think will calculate the numbers we need:"

We'll have to remember to turn the numbers into strings using `str()` so that we can print them:"

We could go through the sequence manually base by base, and verify that there are sixteen As and eighteen Ts, but that doesn't seem like a great use of our time: also, what would we do if the sequence were 51 kilobases rather than 51 bases? A better idea is to run the exact same code with a much shorter test sequence, to verify that it works before going ahead and running it on the larger sequence. \n",
