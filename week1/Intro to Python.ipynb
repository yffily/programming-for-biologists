Just like the `print()` function, the `len()` function takes a single argument (take a quick look back at when we were discussing the `print()` function for a reminder about what arguments are) which is a string. However, the behaviour of `len()` is quite different to that of `print()`. Instead of outputting text to the screen, `len()` outputs a value that can be stored – we call this the **return value**. \n",
