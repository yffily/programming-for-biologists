The `if` line is indented once (shifted four spaces) because that's how we tell python that it is inside the `for` loop, i.e., we want to check whether the first codon is a start codon for **every** sequence. Now we need to communicate to python that the `print` statement is inside the `if` statement, i.e., it should only be executed if the condition is true (if the first codon is a start codon). We do that by indenting the `print` statement **with respect to** the `if` statement. Since the `if` statement is indented once, the `print` statement needs to be indented twice. We say that the `if` statement is nested inside the `for` loop.\n",

First we define a `codon` variable to hold the codon we would like to translate. We also need the list of pairs representing the codon table from last time. You can reuse the exact same code (task 6 in week2.ipynb). Just don't print the entire table (well, print it at first to make sure that part of the code works correctly, but don't print it in the final version). Then, write a loop over the codon-aminoacid pairs in the codon table list. For each pair, check whether the pair's codon (the first element of the pair) matches the codon we're trying to translate.
